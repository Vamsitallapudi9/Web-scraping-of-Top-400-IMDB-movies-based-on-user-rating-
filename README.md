# Top 400 IMDB Movies Web Scraper
This repository gives code for Web scraping of Top 400 IMDB movies based on user rating 

I used Python libraries like Beautiful Soup, Pandas, and Requests to scrape the top 400 movies on IMDB based on user ratings. 
The project includes scraping movie titles, release year, rating, duration, and genre, as well as cleaning and visualizing the data. 
This project gave me valuable experience with web scraping, data analysis, and visualization using Python.
